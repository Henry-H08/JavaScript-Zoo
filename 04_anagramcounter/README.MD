# Counting anagrams

Anagrams are words with the letters in a random order which when sorted create the original word again. This page is used to count the amount of anagrams of a word in a given string. After the user inputs a string and a word it checks that they are valid and then gets the length of both. At the end of the ''go()'' function it outputs the amount of anagrams and what they are.
